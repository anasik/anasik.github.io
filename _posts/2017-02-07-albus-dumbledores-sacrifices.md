Let&#8217;s get to it. We all know about Dumbledore&#8217;s past, and his friendship with Grindelwald and the whole &#8220;For the greater good&#8221; thing. Not all of us, however, realized the fact that he never stopped living his life by that motto. Albus Dumbledore _always _did everything for the greater good.

_&#8220;You&#8217;ve been raising him like a pig for slaughter.&#8221; &#8211; Severus Snape._

Yes, remember that big reveal to Snape? Dumbledore making clear his belief that in order for the Dark Lord to perish Harry had to die? Remember how he didn&#8217;t even try to deny the fact that he was, in fact, just keeping Harry alive so that he could die at the right moment?

But that wasn&#8217;t it. <!--more-->He was also the only person directly responsible for Alastor &#8220;Mad-Eye&#8221; Moody&#8217;s death. Remember how the order let out a false trail about their plans to move Harry from Privet Drive on his 17th birthday? And how Dumbledore told Snape to tell Voldemort that it was a false trail and to actually reveal to Voldemort the date and time of Harry&#8217;s planned departure? Sure he suggested the decoys, but by revealing that information he put the lives of 6 kids and 7 accompanying adults at risk. It was no wonder that one of them died, and another lost an ear.

Let&#8217;s fast forward to _Half-Blood Prince. _Our all-knowing Dumbledore was perfectly aware of the Dark Lord&#8217;s plan to have him murdered. _Yet, _he didn&#8217;t give a damn about how _not doing anything _would put the lives of every other student at risk. Katie and Ron almost died and he didn&#8217;t bat an eyelash.

Despite the genius he believed himself to be, it took him forever to discover the secret behind the Dark Lord&#8217;s immortality and to come up with the possibilities for the Horcruxes. What did he do with that information? Pass it on to 3 unprepared teenagers led by the one who couldn&#8217;t even heal a cut on his hand. He believed that he had the right to decide what to do with that information and beat into Harry the determination to never reveal it to even the closest and the incorruptible. What if the trio had failed? The information would not only have died with them but the rest of the world could have had to face perhaps another century or so of turmoil. It was also an insult and extremely disrespectful to believe that none else could be trusted with it.

The night he died, he believed he was going down after taking down one seventh of Voldemort&#8217;s soul. He didn&#8217;t even bother to check whether or not they had actually made any progress. He so badly craved death and so badly wanted it all to go down perfectly and as planned that he didn&#8217;t even bother to think twice about the kind of situation he was leaving Harry and the rest of the order in. By choosing to die, he practically fled from a battlefield that could have used his help, once again putting the lives of every student, teacher and order member at risk.
