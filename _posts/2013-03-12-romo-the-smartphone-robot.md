Built by Romotive, a team of nerds, Romo is a small, and affordable personal robot which uses an iDevice as its brain. In itself, it is nothing but a set of wheels, but place your iPhone or iPod on it, and it&#8217;ll come to life. Romo wanders about, talks to u, plays with you, and it learns from its surroundings. He even tilts his head back and forth.

Romo can also be remotely controlled by a mac or just another iDevice, and u can also invite your friends or family from all over the world to control Romo through a private url.

Once they download the SDK, users can create and distribute their own apps for Romo, using a simple graphical-programming interface.
