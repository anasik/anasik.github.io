>     C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot 
>     of substandard programmers use it...

>     In other words, the only way to do good, efficient, and system-level and 
>     portable C++ ends up to limit yourself to all the things that are 
>     basically available in C.

>     In general, I'd say that anybody who designs his kernel modules for C++ is 
>     either 
>      (a) looking for problems
>      (b) a C++ bigot that can't see what he is writing is really just C anyway
>      (c) was given an assignment in CS class to do so.
>     
>     Feel free to make up (d).
