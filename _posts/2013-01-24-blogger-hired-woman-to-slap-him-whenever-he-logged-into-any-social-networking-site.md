When San Francisco-based blogger Maneesh Sethi realized he was wasting too much time on Facebook, YouTube and Reddit, he resolved to change his work habits.

His solution: Pay someone $8 an hour to slap him when it appears he’s wasting time on a social network.

The full Craigslist ad reads:

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-style: italic;">                        Hey!</span>

> I’m looking for someone who can work next to me at a defined location (my house or a mission cafe) and will make sure to watch what is happening on my screen. When I am wasting time, you’ll have to yell at me or if need be, slap me.
> 
> You can do your own work at the same time. Looking for help asap, in mission, near 16th mission BART.
> 
> Compensation: $8 / hour, and you can do your own work from your computer at the same time.

The ad, unsurprisingly, received about 20 responses within the first 60 minutes.
