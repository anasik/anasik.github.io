I was browsing through dribbble (I dont really do that very often), when I came across [this](http://dribbble.com/shots/981187-Clink?list=following). Since the animation wasn&#8217;t really running well, I moved on to reading the description (response by the designer himself to be precise), at the bottom of which was a link to the _&#8220;full-video.&#8221; _I followed, but after watching only part of it, I again moved on to the description, and followed the [link therin](http://getclink.co), and that&#8217;s when i fully understood what it all was about.

Clink is actually an app, that allows you to have _drinks _together, while not being together at all. Here&#8217;s an example, it&#8217;s your birthday, and you want to treat your friends to a drink. You&#8217;d open the app and send a _clink _to some bar (bars have to create clink accounts), that acts as a token, carrying details of whatever drink you are offering your friend, and of course you have to pay right-then too, using PayPal.

Though I myself might never use it, I do really appreciate the developers for their effort. The idea or concept behind the project isn&#8217;t bad either, and especially, nowadays when the birthday-guy has to treat the wishers (or they&#8217;d force him into doing so; no escape), this might come in handy..
