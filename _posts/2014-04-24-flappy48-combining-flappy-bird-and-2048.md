Flappy bird and 2048, two of the best games if the year, in terms of their rate of going viral, though totally different in themselves, have been combined into Flappy48.  
The objective is to keep joining the numbers, just like in the game 2048 and eventually reach the 2048 tile, while at the same time, avoiding the obstacles. The obstacles being vertical columns, rather like those green pipes in flappy Bird.  
You start off with a two, and as you flap, you collect more numbers, usually 2s&#8230; This would go on until you reach the 2048 tile.  
The game is based on the unity engine. You can [play it online](http://broxxar.itch.io/flappy48), or download it on your android, though the web version would require you to install the Unity Web Player.  
The game seems finely developed. The theme and scheme is similar to that of 2048, with all solid-ly applied shades from yellow-red.  
The idea itself is great. At least better than the other pointless clones of flappy bird like _flappy doge_ and shit. At least it brings something new.
