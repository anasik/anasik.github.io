The Graph Search really enhances the Facebook search, and with it, you are _slightly more likely to find who, or what you are looking for.Â _All you need to do is type your query in plain English (Just dont take this lineÂ _tooÂ _literally,) mind, dont go totally casual.

> â†‘The new Graph Search

In simple words, with the new graph search, _&#8220;__Filtering Search Results&#8221;Â _is easier. All right, _lets go back to the past_, (mind! only a few days back), with theÂ _Classic-old-Facebook-Search,Â _which some of you might still be using, let&#8217;s say that you want to search for a Guy named &#8220;_Jack Robinson&#8221;Â _who went to _&#8220;Oxford.&#8221;Â _

> â†‘The old classic search

You&#8217;d type &#8220;Jack Robinson&#8221; in the search bar and click on the search-button, (_ifÂ _the person&#8217;s profile does not appear in the 1st few results,)_Â _and once it dislays &#8220;_All Results&#8221;,Â _You&#8217;d go for a few search filters, adding which Â  isn&#8217;t muchÂ _user-friendlyÂ _either.

Now, with the new graph-search, all you need to do is type: &#8220;_People named Jack Robinson who went to Oxford.&#8221;Â _That&#8217;s it. Of course I cant guarantee that the graph search will always get you to the right thing, but the point is that itÂ _does make searching for people or stuff easy,Â _and so far, to me, it&#8217;s returned naught but relevant results. It&#8217;s not exactly limited to 2 filters; you can add as many as you want e.g. &#8220;_People named Jack Robinson who went to Oxford and are friends of Sam Slater.&#8221; e.t.c.Â _It&#8217;s pretty flexible actually and really worth giving a try. ðŸ˜‰
