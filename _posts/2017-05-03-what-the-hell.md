So I was minding my own business in my humble abode when I receive an email. A quick look at my phone&#8217;s notification bar tells me that it was from the admissions counselor (, let&#8217;s call her Daisy,) of a college that had accepted me. I wasn&#8217;t at all surprised because the decision day for that college had just passed and I hadn&#8217;t shared mine at all.

The email said &#8220;Daisy has shared a document with you.&#8221; And had a button that said:<span style="background-color: #4d90fe; border: 1px solid #3079ed; border-radius: 2px; color: white; display: inline-block; font-family: Roboto,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold; height: 29px; line-height: 29px; min-width: 54px; outline: 0px; padding: 0 8px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;">Open in Docs.</span>

Like a dumbass, I clicked on it. I did wonder why she&#8217;d share a document with me and I did, kinda, wonder why it didn&#8217;t look like the average Google Doc invitation, but I was on my phone and I chose to overlook it.

Then I land on a page that asks me if I want Google Drive to have access to my email account. It asked for permissions like &#8220;Edit, delete and create emails.&#8221; I was certain, by this point, that something was not right. And I just allowed it. You know why? Cause the goddamned address bar clearly showed that I was still on Google and still on https. I was redirected and then it appeared to be completing a request and loading something and after waiting for a few minutes, I realized what I had done.

Now I noticed another weird email, and it said &#8220;Anas Khan has shared a document with you.&#8221; That was it. Now I realized what those permissions were for. I checked the sent mail and realized that this shit had forwarded itself to &#8220;hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com&#8221; and that email was BCC&#8217;d to virtually every email address that I had ever communicated with.

Well, kinda screwed up. But I have to say this: It was a clever scam.
