Once while going through the cpanel of my site i came across a tool cause RVSkin. It&#8217;s basically a tool that allows you to fully customize the cpanel theme. The only problem with it is that once you activate it, there is no option of reverting back to the original one.

Well, just copy and paste this link into your address bar:

[http://**_domain.com_**:2082/cpsess6507594894/frontend/x3/style/switchstyle.html?brandingpkg](http://anasismail.com:2082/cpsess6507594894/frontend/x3/style/switchstyle.html?brandingpkg)=

> Note: Replace **_domain.com_** with your own domain, PLUS, this will only work when you are logged into your cpanel.
