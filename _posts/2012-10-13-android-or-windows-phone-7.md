Have to buy a new cell phone. Wondering what OS to buy.  HTC 7 mozart is some Windows phone 7 smartphone with its 8mp camera,  1ghz processor, 512MB ROM and 576MB ram. Only it has no proper file management nor a card slot. It comes with 8GB internal storage.  And all the windows phone apps available on the appstore are for windows phone 7.5 or higher, while HTC 7 mozart has got Windows phone 7.0, so what if none of the good apps are compatible for it? Another limitation of the windows phone 7 is that it is totally dependent on ZUNE.

And when you take a look at Android, HTC ONE V seems the best so far for me.  It comes with android 4.0.3, internal 4GB storage, microSD card slot (upto 32GB support,) 512MB RAM, 1GHZ processor and 5MP camera. Not to mention that android does fully support file managers.

Of course Android is the better option but i’m quite keen to try a windows phone 7!
