I was watchingÂ [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEz_zs67hwY), and below it I found this comment:

> <a class="spf-link branded-page-header-title-link yt-uix-sessionlink" dir="ltr" title="irishdancingchicken" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/irishdancingchicken" data-sessionlink="ei=36vGWOOeF8-vW7-9h7gM">irishdancingchicken</a>: (Possible spoilers) Listen to the lyrics: &#8220;I&#8217;ll shut down the city lights,&#8221; like Electro did. &#8220;When enemies are at your door, I&#8217;ll carry you away from war&#8221; &#8211; he tried to. &#8220;Your hope dangling by a string&#8221; = her life literally dangling by a string/web. &#8220;I&#8217;ll love you long after your gone&#8221; &#8211; he does. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t like the song or artist, the filmmakers knew what they were doing when they put it in there.
