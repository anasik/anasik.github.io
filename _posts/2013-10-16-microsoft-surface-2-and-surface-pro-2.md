Couple of days back, Microsoft announced the &#8216;coming&#8217; of the new Microsoft Surface 2 and the Surface Pro 2; the former being the successor to Surface RT, while the latter of course succeeds the Surface Pro.

So, what else did Microsoft say about the two? and what new features do they pack?  
First off, to the new and similar _&#8216;features&#8217;_. Both of them now come with a, what they call,Â _&#8220;dual-angle Kickstand&#8221;_Â , that can be adjusted to meet your requirements, so called improvements in battery life, &#8216;faster&#8217; _&#8216;than ever before,&#8217;Â _ HD Screens, and support for USB 3.0. With both, you get about 200GB on SkyDrive free for 2 years, along withÂ an year of &#8216;unlimited free voice calling to landlines in over 60 countries&#8217;, and &#8216;free Skype Wi-Fi at over 2 million hotspots worldwide.&#8217;

Now to the DIfferences.  
The Surface 2 comes pre-installed with Windows RT, and touch optimized Office RT, to which, the addition of Outlook has been made. Battery life of about 10 hours, and theÂ NVIDIA Tegra 4 processor ensure that you work &#8216;faster&#8217; and &#8216;longer&#8217; ðŸ˜›

The Pro 2 would come with Windows 8.1, packs an Intel Core i5 Processor, and about 512GB of Storage. They alsoÂ _sayÂ _that they&#8217;ve _&#8216;taken advantage of the latest processor technology to provide longer battery life on a single charge.&#8217;Â _Apart from that, it has its own stylus i.e. theÂ _Pro_ Pen, and a &#8216;Â brilliant 1080p widescreen display.&#8217;

Accessories include a Docking Station, Wireless adapter for type-covers, the touch/type-covers of course, and theÂ Surface Music Kit (similar to the covers), anÂ Arc Touch Mouse, and a car charger.
