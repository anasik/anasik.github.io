Downloaded the VDI hosted at [virtualboxes.org](http://virtualboxes.org/images/damn-small).  
Simple to the extent where you find yourself drowning in a variety of options on a confusing UI.  
Though the image is packed with a whole lot of tools, (that account for Its size, 200+MBA), installing stuff and customizing it to suit your needs isn&#8217;t really as simple as it might seem. Definitely not an option for a General consumer looking for a feather-light distro, and requires a bit of tuning before it can be of much use..
