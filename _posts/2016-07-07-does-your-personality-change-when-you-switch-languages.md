[Lifehack thinks so](http://www.lifehack.org/419220/multilinguals-experience-personality-change-when-using-different-languages?ref=fbp&n=1), and I can&#8217;t help but agree. It&#8217;s something I have always noticed. Sometimes you switch languages while talking simply because you feel that some things are better said in a particular language.Different languages allow us to express ourselves differently.

From what I believe, it&#8217;s not a matter of having as many personalities as the languages you know, but a matter of how much _at home_ you are with them. Some languages don&#8217;t allow you to be yourself as much as others and vice versa.
