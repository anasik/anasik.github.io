Alan Rickman, the English actor, well known for playing Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movie series, passed away at the age of 69 today. They say he had cancer. (<del><em>No I don&#8217;t know which cancer it was,nor have I got any idea about how long he had had it and how much people knew about it. )</em></del>

Being one of those that hate Snape during the first 6.7 books, and at the end can&#8217;t help but forgive him, and also one of those who have seen Rickman as Snape for so long that they can&#8217;t see him as anyone else, _(he did, after all, make a great Snape,) _I feel strangely sad about the news. Still, I don&#8217;t plan to write an essay. I&#8217;ve said what I had to say.

> When I&#8217;m 80 years old and sitting in my rocking chair, I&#8217;ll be reading Harry Potter. And my family will say to me, &#8220;After all this time?&#8221; And I will say, &#8220;Always.&#8221; &#8211; Rickman.
