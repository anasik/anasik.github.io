If you&#8217;ve ever tried building on the Cleverscript, or if you&#8217;ve ever played around with Spreadsheets, you might have come across the terms &#8220;Tab-delimited-file&#8221; or &#8220;comma separated values,&#8221; and few often wonder what the terms really mean.

In simple terms, these are simply formats that save spreadsheets in plain text, i.e. in a manner that can be viewed and easily understood through a simple text editor like Notepad, Gedit, leafpad e.t.c

In a tab delimited file, every line is a row, and the columns are separated by tabs. This sheet for example:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8555/10222358016_4b6f4701ee_o.png" width="97%" />
</div>

Would look like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/10222454133_b7520b76ea_o.png" width="97%" />
</div>

when viewed through leafpad.

Similarly, when you go for &#8216;comma seperated values&#8217; it uses commas instead of tabs, for example, the same file would look like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8123/10222472136_df3f59b877_o.png" />
</div>
