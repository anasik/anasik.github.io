The Ubuntu Edge is an upcoming _state-of-the-art _smartphone, more-like, just a project for now, that would feature the fastest multi-core processor they can get their hands on, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage, and LTE antennae on either side.

But the thing that makes it unique is.. that&#8217;s right, you&#8217;ve guessed it; yeah, _no rear camera_ 🙁 . **Just kidding.** Actually, it _dual-boots _Android and Ubuntu touch.

The idea behind the project being, porting a complete desktop OS into a phone, when docked, the Ubuntu OS will start on your computer, running right _from the phone. _

Well, do check out the video, i.e. if u havent already.
