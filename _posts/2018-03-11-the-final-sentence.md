I&#8217;ve been reading books, more than I&#8217;ve been reading lately, lately. Very often, I read them onscreen. A while back, I was starting with H.G. Wells&#8217; &#8220;The Time Machine&#8221; and the PDF I found had about somewhere slightly above a hundred pages in it and it made me wonder if that was actually the whole book and not a truncated version and so I googled for the last sentence of the book to see if it matched the one in the PDF.

I ended up finding [this tumblr blog called &#8220;The Final Sentence&#8221;](http://the-final-sentence.tumblr.com/t_prose) that exists solely to serve as an archive of the final sentences of all books. I think it&#8217;s pretty cool actually and every once in a while, it makes me feel better about a crappy PDF.
