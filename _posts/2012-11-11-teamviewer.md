[Teamviewer](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx) is a Remote desktop Utility, which allows you remotely access another PC on the network. When you run teamviewer, you are assigned with an ID and a password(which difffers in every session\run.)<span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;">Â </span>

<a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerQS.exe">Download</a>.

So, here&#8217;s the whole procedure. One person starts teamviewer and tells his ID and password to the other who inputs his ID into this input box that says &#8220;Partner ID,&#8221; and clicks &#8220;Connect to Partner,&#8221; On which he is prompted for a password and in return, he gains access to the First person&#8217;s PC.
