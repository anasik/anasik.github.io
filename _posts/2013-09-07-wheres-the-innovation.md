Two days back, Sony unveiled its Xperia Z1 smartphone, that packs a 2.2Ghz Quad-core processor and a 20.7MP camera, and the same magnificent display, perhaps _that&#8217;s _a little larger too, and that&#8217;s the point. Every now and then, a new phone comes out, and it&#8217;s pretty hard to choose the best among them, as the competition is tough, but what exactly is it that a day-newer smartphone carries? A slightly better processor? perhaps an _extremely high-res _camera? or a water proof display? Or&#8230;Just a larger screen.

If this is what makes one phone superior over the other, then it&#8217;s no competition, considering that one carries better hardware, and thus is bound to perform better. Comparing a dual-core HTC with a Quad-core Samsung, or comparing the Water-proof Xperia with a _normal _Huawei, or a 41MP Lumia with any camera-ed device is similar to comparing a tank with a Vespa _(no offence meant)_.

When Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone, in 2007, it didn&#8217;t pack a Quad-core either, but it really hit the market, and people fell in love with the idea, _cause it was one. _The idea behind the iPhone wasn&#8217;t to sell Dual-cores or water-proof phones, or integrated cameras,  or even _fancy touch screens, _but it was the Revolutionary UI that set it apart from others. If you dont get it, simply watch the video,( it&#8217;s available on Youtube, so i wont bother sharing a link.)

And soon, support for something similar was ported into Android, which arrived a bit earlier than the iOS, and yet, the latter is considered to be superior, (though personally, i love both.) That Android is what powers up most of todays&#8217; smartphones, and the best of which is itself based on Steve Jobs _Revolutionary UI._

True that Samsung introduced the &#8216;smart pause&#8217; and the &#8216;eye focus&#8217; is another rumored release, but even these two, though a huge leap, aren&#8217;t exactly needed, nor are they going to make life better for us.. They are simply building up on the same thing and adding to it, whatever they see, but this won&#8217;t do. They are supposed to be building _mobile devices _but going on the wrong track by enlarging the screen with every release. Similarly, it&#8217;s good for the phones to carry a camera, but the phone is not _supposed to be _a camera. The eye tracking thing of Samsung&#8217;s, is in itself, good, but do we really need it? though it sounds pretty simpler, it might put strain to the eyes, and it might be a bit error-prone, and _what&#8217;s the point of it being in a phone? _

The floating touch / motion control, rumored to be in some model of Xperia, and the latter in SmartTVs, is pretty advanced too, but we dont need all this in our phones.. People prefer simplicity. Microsoft could have introduced it in their windows phones ages ago if they wanted too, seeing as we&#8217;ve seen something similar yet better in the XBox, but they dont have to or need to. The Simple UI of the Windows Phone 7+ is an example, of how they are keeping it simple, and how people are loving it.

The MotoX introduced the _talk to your phone _thing, and that was kinda something new, and so was the _shake to open _camera, though they are minor improvements, but do fall in the category next to the the Huawei&#8217;s Screen Temperature, HTC Zoe, and the Samsung&#8217;s counterpart to Zoe.

Nowadays, all _improvements _that are made to the _smartphones _are enlarging the screen or making it _persistent, _better RAMs or CPUs e.t.c., or perhaps in terms of better software, but it&#8217;s still the same _smartphone._ Where&#8217;s all the creativity, the _innovation_? Are they really running out of ideas?
