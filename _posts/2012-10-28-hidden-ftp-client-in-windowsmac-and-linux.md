We all use FTP clients like FileZilla, CoreFTP, SmartFTP. Most people use Graphical Interfaces, but some even prefer Command line, but only 10% know about the hidden CLI FTP client that comes with the OS.

Just type FTP in cmd(Terminal in Linux or Mac) and press enter.

For a list of available commands, type help and press enter.
