The Moto X, another upcomingÂ _state-of-the-artÂ _smartphone, of whose release date, i myself am unaware kinda redefines the term smartphones, and gives its company quite aÂ _riseÂ _in theÂ _world-of-smartphones._Â Before the launch, the leaks, the rumors, Motorolla wasnt exactly the best choice, nor did much people ever even bother to consider it (but well,Â _no offence meant.Â _Â And well the same story goes for Samsung)_  
_ 

So anyways, theÂ _Always ReadyÂ _smartphoneÂ _Designed By You_, that has aÂ _Quick CaptureÂ _feature to ensure that youÂ _Never Miss a Shot,Â _really does has it all, and it could be quite some boost for the company which has by the way been acquired by Google.__

Starting with theÂ _**Motomaker.**Â _Notice the phrase &#8216;_Designed by You&#8217;Â _that i used above?  
_Yes it means what it means.Â _The Motomaker is, or is gonna be, a website where you are gonna customize your order before buying it. Customization includes choosing colors for the back and front, and evenÂ _accentsÂ _which refers to stuff like the Volume buttons and well the border round the rear camera. You can even add a signature at the back, which is similar to theÂ _iPod Engravings.Â _And well you can choose a case too.

But that was theÂ _StylingÂ _bit. Then comesÂ _Features,Â _where you can choose between 16 and 32GB storage, add a custom _greetingÂ _on startup, Oh and you also have the option of connecting your google account right there.

AfterÂ _Features,Â _We haveÂ _Accessories,Â _A wall charger is included, and you can also add-onÂ _EarphonesÂ _(color of your choice ðŸ˜‰ ). That&#8217;s it! The phone will be shipped to you within 4 days.



> The Motomaker; kinda a demo video

So that was the Motomaker; no it doesnt end here; now to the**Â **_**Quick Capture**Â _which involves starting the camera app with a flick of the wrist.Â _Useful!Â _especially when you are in the middle of those moments when you hardly have a second to waste.

Here&#8217;s an example:  


But what&#8217;s thisÂ **_Always Ready_**_Â _thing?  
This merely refers to the fact that the phone is always responding to you when you want it to. You can simply talk to it. Give it orders, tell it what to do. This is pretty close toÂ _SiriÂ _found in iPhones.



> See how he said &#8216;_Ok, Google now&#8217;Â _and the phone went intoÂ _Listening Mode._

Well, that was it. I know the features arent exactly totallyÂ _unheard-ofÂ _orÂ _unimaginableÂ _but well its definitely worth a shot.
