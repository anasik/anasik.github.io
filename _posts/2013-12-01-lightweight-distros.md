I used to think the Lubuntu was capable of running on any machine available, until I read on some blog a post where a guy was hoping to find a nice damn-light distro for his Toshiba Satellite 300CDT, that had only 4GB storage and 48mb of RAM..  
Well, guy could do with [slax](http://anasismail.com/slax-a-plug-and-play-operating-system/), as the minimum memory [requirements](http://www.slax.org/documentation.php) for the 32bit version inn text mode happen to be exactly 48mb&#8230;
