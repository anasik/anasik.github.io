The Nokia Lumia 1020, that&#8217;s said to be available on AT&T by the 26th of July, makes _even the best of DSLR&#8217;s look inferior,_ it&#8217;s own _rear-camera being  41MP with a max resolution of 7712 x 5360_. Lenses: **Zeiss**, Flash is Xenon for _still-captures_, while there&#8217;s an LED one for Videos, their quality being 1080p, 30fps.

So well, let&#8217;s move to the rest of the specifications; Starting with Display. Screen-size is 4.5&#8243;, 15:9 aspect ratio, AMOLED **_Gorrilla Glass._**_ _Processor&#8217;s a 1.5GHz Dual-core snapdragon; _slight disappointment _for those expecting a quad-core. RAM 2GB, and Storage capacity 32GB, and front-camera is 1.2MP; another _dissappointment. _ __

Well, _quite a charm, _and i&#8217;d love to get my hands on one. Who cares if it aint quad-core eh? It&#8217;s 41MP, and well, 2GB of RAM aint bad either. + its _not-being-a-quad-core _makes it comparatively _more-affordable,_ seeing as the same model with a quad-core wont exactly go cheap._ _
