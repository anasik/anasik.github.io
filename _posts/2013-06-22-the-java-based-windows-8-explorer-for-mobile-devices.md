TheÂ **&#8220;[Windows 8 Mobile &#8211; Java Explorer](http://nokia-2730-classic.java-mobiles.net/software/windows-8-explorer-blue-ftp-download-free-214993.html)&#8221;Â **is a really advanced file explorer forÂ _classic mobile devices,Â _that don&#8217;t exactly supportÂ _advanced computingÂ _(dear me, im not sure whether or not this was the right term.) Such devices include all Nokia OS(s40), Symbian phones (at least nokia&#8217;s) and every other device that supports Java Apps.

I&#8217;ve tested it on a Nokia 2700 Classic, Nokia C3-01, Nokia X2-01, Touchtel SOLO, Â Nokia C101, oh yeah and aÂ **BlackBerry Curve 9300.**

Now what exactly is so good about it. Well, glossing over the fewÂ _basic and essentialÂ _file-management utilites, i.e. cut, copy, paste, move e.t.c. , It comes with a fully featured archiver, capable of opening, extracting and even creating ZIP, RAR, BZIP e.t.c. and even JAR and NTH archives.

Apart from that, it has an in built FTP utility, using which, you can remotely _file-manageÂ _another device connected to yours via Bluetooth.

Well, that&#8217;s all I can remember right now, but i assure you, that&#8217;s not all, it has several other features, and well, believe it or not, it&#8217;s the best File-Manager that exists for such devices. An alternative is the [Moby Explorer](http://nokia-2730-classic.java-mobiles.net/software/mobyexplorer-3-1-registered-version-download-free-215842.html) which is kinda based on the former, but is slightly short on a few features that it has replaced with his own. Â So both are worth trying.

Do give em a try if your device supports them. ðŸ˜‰
