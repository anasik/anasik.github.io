Nowadays, you cant surf around fb, without coming across some confessions page. It&#8217;s just another trend, like those viral videos of Gangnam Style and Harlem Shake, that spread like worms. The idea behind these confessions page is that everyone feels uncomfortable about certain _things_ and has trouble sharingÂ _stuff, holds secrets_, and to make them public, one can simply message the page admin, and he&#8217;d post whatever the person has to say.

The first such page i came across was the &#8220;TWS Sixth Form Confessions&#8221; which was limited to a certain organization, and such pages have been appearing ever since, with a rate that is increasing by the day.
