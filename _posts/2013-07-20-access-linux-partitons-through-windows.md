Linux and Windows, two of the most widely used OS&#8217;, and _&#8216;which one is better&#8217;_ is _highly debatable_. Now both have their own pros and cons, and well, _experience _can be a bit _different _and _frustrating_, when switching from one to the other.

Well, a common problem usually faced, especially by those who go for a dual-boot, is that Windows cant read/write/access Linux partions, while on the other hand, Linux can Windows&#8217;. But there are a variety of tools available that _do enable _you to access Linux partitions through Windows. Some only offer the _read _feature, while some even let you _write _changes to the disk.

After trying a whole bunch of them, the best i could find was the ParagonExtFS. This one works on all 3, i.e. XP, 7 and 8, and it has no confusing UI to deal with. Just a simple _mount _feature, just as in Linux, and thats it. Now you can Explore, view and edit Linux files through the Windows Explorer.

You can download ParagonExtFs from [here](http://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-windows/download.html). _Yes _you have to register, but well doesn&#8217;t exactly matter. Just fill in the form with whatever&#8217;s required and click submit.

Now, check your email, i.e. the address you provided while filling in the form, for an email from **eservice@paragon-software, **that contains the download link.

_Installing _and _operating _is relatively easy, once installed, just run it, and a box will popup carrying a list of partitions; Linux ones marked yellow. Select a partition and mount it; specify a drive letter and thats it. Now you can explore the partition normally through the windows explorer.
