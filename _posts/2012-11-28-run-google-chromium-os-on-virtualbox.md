Chromium OS is an open-source, linux-based operating system, designed by google to work with web based applications. Its quite a simple one really, and not the sort everyone would like, in fact, the only application it comes with is a browser (though of course you can install more apps.)

Anyways if you feel like trying it, there are two ways to do so. The first is to [download the disk image](http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/index.php), burn a usb or dvd with it and boot with it. But if you dont wanna take any risks, you can [try it on virtual box](http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/index.php).Â All you need is [virtual box](http://virtualbox.org), and the [Chrome OS Virtual Disk](http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/index.php "Get it here").

The Process is simple. Start Virtual Box and create a new Machine. Select Linux [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) as the OS Type, and when you come to the &#8220;Hard Drive&#8221; part, check &#8220;Use an Existing virtual hard drive file, and browse to the one you just downloaded. That&#8217;s it.

Now start the machine, the configuration process would hardly take a minute. Then just login with your google account.
