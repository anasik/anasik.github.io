The React OS project is an operating system written from scratch that follows the design and architecture of Windows NT. The idea behind it was to launch a free and open-source operating system that would enable windows programs and drivers to run on your PC.

Now, what you must be thinking is: &#8220;Why the hell would one want to go for such an OS when we already have got Windows?&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s cause ReactOS is free and open-source, means that you are free to customize it to suit your needs. It&#8217;s not just an alternative, but a free alternative to Microsoft Windows.

It&#8217;s pretty light actually. You can [download it from the reactOS site](http://www.reactos.org/download), though i&#8217;d advise you to try it on a VM first, cause you might not find it as interesting as it sounds.
