The XBMC is an application designed to serve as a free alternative to Windows media center, and is available for several platforms, and even has its own standalone version known as the XMBCbuntu which, _yes_, is based on ubuntu.

It was originally created for the original Xbox console, but as it got popular, they made it available for several platforms.
