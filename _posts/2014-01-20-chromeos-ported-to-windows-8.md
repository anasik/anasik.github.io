Yes this is the latest version of Google Chrome running in Metro on Windows 8.1 preview. It&#8217;s like the whole of ChromeOS is being simulated in an app, (and that _is_ the whole idea behind it.)  
Strange yet smart move; let&#8217;s see if either this or the launchers can get people to use and actually get comfortable with the Chrome Apps environment..
