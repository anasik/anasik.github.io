Tofu, @tofu_product, is a Twitter account, that seems to have a thing for confusing tweets, and following General public.  
Actually, it is supposed to be a bot. The moment you follow him, he&#8217;d follow you back, and he&#8217;d go through your tweets, make something out of them, and tweet it to you.. sounds stupid eh? But that&#8217;s more or less like what happens. A Tofu tweet normally doesnt make much sense.  
Do give it a try, find him on Twitter and follow him. He&#8217;d follow you back instantly. Wait for another few minutes and he is bound to tweet something to you..
