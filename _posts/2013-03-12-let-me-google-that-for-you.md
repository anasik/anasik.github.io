> Let me google that for you

LMGTFY is a tool, or more like a _sarcastic_ search spider, that tells google to search for whatever keywords you input. The actual idea behind it is that some annoying jerks keep on asking you stuff every now and then, without bothering to research (at all) themselves, and finally, there comes a time when you give up and tell them to _google_ whatever it is that they want to know.

LMGTFY generates a link, that you can send to any such jerk, and it actually _googlesÂ _the query for them. _Confused? eh?_

**Here&#8217;s an example (click on the following link):**
