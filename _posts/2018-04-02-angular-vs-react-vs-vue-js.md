This is the shortest and most effective comparison that aims to make the decision making process easier.

**Angular:Â **

Pros:

  * The oldest and therefore very mature.
  * A complete framework in itself and ideal for large projects.
  * The MEAN stack remains, to date, one of the most popular stacks for web-development so finding jobs is never tough for Angular developers.
  * With NativeScript, you can use it to develop smartphone apps.

Cons:

  * If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t like or don&#8217;t want to learn TypeScript, I would suggest staying away from it because the current releases are TypeScript based.
  * Packed with features, it&#8217;s a huge framework and therefore takes a fair amount of time to learn and master.

**React:**

Pros:

  * Been around for a fair amount of time and therefore can be said to be just as mature as Angular.
  * Smaller than Angular and therefore easier to learn.
  * Just as popular, if not more, and therefore has a well-developed community.
  * Just as many jobs out there for it as for Angular.
  * React Native allows for it to be used to make Android apps.

Cons:

  * You will have to learn JSX. Basically the idea is that in ReactJS, you try to maximize your use of JS and minimize your use of HTML. JSX kinda merges both. Obviously this adds to the learning curve.
  * Not a complete framework. React Developers almost always use Redux or some other flux implementation for state management. Code often becomes a real mess with large projects.

**Vue.JS:**

Pros:

  * Has just as many features as React, if not more.
  * Small enough for you to be able to learn it in a single day.
  * Great for small projects.
  * Gaining popularity real quick.
  * Resembles the original Angular.JS so if you are familiar with it, you&#8217;d love Vue.
  * Unlike React, with Vue, the goal is to maximize the use of HTML and minimize the use of JS.
  * Although not a complete framework, it comes with it&#8217;s own router and flux implementation, that, although independent projects, offer seamless integration with Vue itself.

Cons:

  * Relatively new and therefore has a small community and fewer jobs are available.
  * NativeScript has a plugin for Vue support but it not supposed to be ready for development yet. Although, it seemed pretty functional when I tried it.
