They actually shot lasers at the moon, to measure the distance between the earth and the moon, which were reflected elsewhere by the retroreflecters planted earlier, during the Apollo 11 Program?  
Well, maybe it wasn&#8217;t a hoax as they say, but where exactly did they reflect the lasers to? Hopefully, not on some other part of the earth but somewhere in mere space.
