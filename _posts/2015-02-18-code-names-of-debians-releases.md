Umm, yes. I think there is, but it&#8217;s of course too much of a coincidence that every single one of Debian&#8217;s releases is code-named after Toy Story characters.

Rex, Bo, Hamm, Slink, they&#8217;re all there, not to mention Woody. And guess what? _Even Wheezy made it_, (though i hope that was after he got his squeaker fixed.) Now to follow is Jessie, but _Damn!Â _That&#8217;s one long wait for Buzz, but on the plus side, she&#8217;s almost there.
