First of, the &#8216;b&#8217; stands for _bit, _while the B stands for _byte. _So MB stands for _megabyte, _and Mb stands for _megabit. _The _Mi, Ki, Gi_ prefixes are **binary prefixes.** The  difference between Mb and Mibit is that MB represents 1000² bits, while Mibit represents 1024² bits. Same goes for Kb and Kibit.

So if it says 2MB, then its 2 \* 1000² \* 8 bits, and when it says 2Mb, then its 2 * 1000² bits.  
When it&#8217;s 2Mibit, then it&#8217;s 2 \* 1024² bits, and when it&#8217;s 2MiB it&#8217;s 2 \* 1024² * 8 bits.
