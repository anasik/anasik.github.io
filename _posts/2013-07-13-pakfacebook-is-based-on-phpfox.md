[PakFacebook](http://pakfacebook.com) is a social network, that was launched as an _alternative _right after Facebook was banned for the first time in Pakistan, that did kinda resemble the real facebook, in both i.e. the _visuals, _and the _functionality. _

After coming across a link on Facebook, that led me to [phpfox](http://phpfox.com), which is a complete social networking solution, I realize that Pakfacebook is _highly _or should I say _totally _based on phpFox, or the latter on the former, cause there&#8217;s no saying who owns which. But I&#8217;ve seen enough to tell that it&#8217;s the same thing.
