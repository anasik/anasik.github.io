Old, but well, GOLD. &#8216;GTA United&#8217; was a &#8216;total-conversion-mod&#8217; for GTA San Andreas, which lacked in missions, but for _free-roamers_, It&#8217;s fun.

All _features _ are the same as SA, but the _thing,_ that makes it special is it&#8217;s map, comprising only of, the whole of Liberty City(from GTA 3), and Vice City. The two cities are only _inter-accessible _by sea, or air; no land route.

The fun-part is that it kinda enhances GTA3 and Vice City, so the lack of missions doesnt account for much. All the Clubs, in both the cities are slightly _real-er _as they are in SA. Same goes for the Clothing and ammunition stores. You no longer get _one outfit per store, _ but can shop for whatever ones you like, but when it comes to the Ammunition stores(Ammu-Nation), I sometimes miss the vice-city ones; much _faster_, though i agree that they were not at all _real_, seeing as the _dealer _ hardly ever moved.

Apart from that, you can _swim, _which would come in handy while performing crazy stunts, while on the run from the law.
