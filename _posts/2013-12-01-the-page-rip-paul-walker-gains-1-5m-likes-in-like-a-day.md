99% of the posts in our news-feed seem so say naught but stuff like &#8220;RIP Paul Walker.&#8221; Walker, an actor best known for his role as Connor O&#8217;Brien, in the Fast and the Furious movie series, died yesterday in a car crash.  
Someone, no idea who, created this page on Facebook, with the name RIP Paul Walker, that has about 1.5m likes right now, and from the look of it.. it does look a day old..Â  Guy did seriously have quite some fan base..
