Often you might have come across websites that have been blocked by your ISP, an example is youtube, which is blocked in Pakistan. To access such websites, you can use a proxy server. There are dozens of sites offering free web proxy; ONLINE. The most popular one is [12345proxy.net](http://12345proxy.net), though in my opinion, the best one is [Umer Rock&#8217;s Pro](http://www.bestproxysite.appspot.com/)[xy Server](http://www.bestproxysite.appspot.com/).

But using such services can be tiring, the other option is to use some Software,  this one is slightly more preferrable and preferred.

Now, the thing is that not all of the proxy sites and tools work on Youtube. About an year ago I was fine with ultrasurf, but now if i use ultrasurf, i am able to surf Youtube, but it displays an error whenever i try to play a video. Same goes for many others.

If you wanna go for some software, then the best option is to [download and install Hotspot Shield](http://download.cnet.com/hotspot-shield/). It integrates with your browser automatically, just make sure it is connected.

So, the conclusion is that if u wanna use some online tool, go for [Umer Rock&#8217;s Proxy Server](http://bestproxysite.appspot.com), but if u wanna use some software, go for Hostpot.
