Nokia launches the first Windows 8 phone. [Nokia Lumia 920](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_920-4967.php).

With a 768 x 1280 pixels(4.5 inches) Screen, Corning Gorilla Glass, and an 8MP autofocus camera, Not to forget the 1gb ram, and 1.5ghz dualcore processor! (Comes in four colors: Black, Gray, Red, Yellow, White.)

However, like all other Windows phone 7 and 8 phones, it doesnt have a card slot. (comes with 32GB internal storage.)
