I have recently been faced with this challenge, partly for learning, as it&#8217;s kind of an enthusiast thing and partly because I might actually need to to that in the near future. Since the title might seem a bit vague or ambigous to some, let me first make a bit clear exactly what it is I&#8217;m after. How about we start by listing interpretations? _(My goal and the whole point of all this can be seen to later.)_

Router A= TL-WR841N, and this one&#8217;s configured to connect to the internet using PPTP

Router B = Tenda W268R,

  1. I have two routers, and I want BÂ to act as a wireless access point to extend it&#8217;s range.
  2. I have two routers, and I want B to have a LAN of it&#8217;s own, with A as a gateway providing access to the internet.
  3. I want to do either of the things listed above over a wireless bridge.

Let me say this much. I am a newbie. I&#8217;m not much of a networking guy, nor do I really know how this is going to work. I&#8217;m simply Google-ing and experimenting.

In the next few posts, I will explain what I have tried and what was the outcome.
