If you visit a site sporting GTA Mods, you&#8217;d see hundreds of Car mods, Player models, e.t.c. most of them containing naught but new models and textures. The question is &#8220;_How to install them?_&#8221; Do we have to erase the existing models, in order to replace them with the new ones? _Yes!_

So, to do this, _the simplest and most user friendly way_ is to use Â the [IMG tool](https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegtaplace.com%2Fdownloads%2Ff552-img-tool-2-0&ei=DznQUYeFOobl4QSx7YHIAw&usg=AFQjCNFkeZOg0C7WtEkfe2Jp4Uhjfj-QHw&sig2=mHgF5P8_WDed_umniKVLoQ&bvm=bv.48572450,d.bGE). So, once you&#8217;ve downloaded it(no install required), simply open the file gta3.img using the executable you just downloaded. The file can be found in the &#8216;Models&#8217; folder.

Now, for example, if you are replacing the car &#8220;Banshee&#8221; with a mod you just downloaded, search for &#8220;Banshee.dff&#8221;, and &#8220;Banshee.txd&#8221;. Delete both, and if you dont feel good about it, you may backup; simply extract the files and store them somewhere.

Once deleted, just import the newer &#8220;Banshee.dff, and Banshee.txd.&#8221; That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re done!

> Note: Not every mod requires changes to be made in the &#8216;gta3.img&#8217; file. Until VC, this was a.. well, STANDARD. But in SA, some player mods, e.g. Clothes e.t.c. might require opening &#8220;Player.img&#8221; But the procedure remains the same.
