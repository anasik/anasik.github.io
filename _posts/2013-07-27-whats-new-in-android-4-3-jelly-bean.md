TheÂ _newly launched_, version of Android comes with its own range of exciting features, ranging from apparentÂ _visual effectsÂ _toÂ _not-to-apparentÂ _security fixes.One of the apparent features being a user account system,Â **Restricted ProfilesÂ **as Google calls it. The purpose of the new user account feature, (i guess not much explanation required) is merely to ensure thatÂ _multiple-users-on-a-single-deviceÂ _dont have much trouble managing their docs e.t.c. and yes it also kinda improves privacy, i.e. files you dont want other users to access.

Then there&#8217;s the support for [Bluetooth Smart Devices](http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices.aspx), and yes some sort of built&#8211;in anti-virus tool, which i think wasnt there in the earlier versions, **Actionable NotificationsÂ **e.g. instant-reply to a just-received email, right from the notification bar, oh and it also includes **dynamic widgets**(that resize by themselves ðŸ˜€ ),Â a smart-share feature, called the _Android Beam_Â similar to Â the Galaxy s3&#8217;s S-beam.**  
** 

Another of its amazing features is theÂ **Photo Sphere,**Â which is similar to aÂ _panoramaÂ _but that&#8217;s like a cyllinder while this is more like a whole sphere. Panoramas capture 360Â° horizontaly, while a Photo sphere captures 360Â° inÂ _any direction._
