Yesterday, when going through a list of updates that had to be installed, I noticed that the icon of the messenger had changed into a round-er, and light colored one, rather like the new icons in iOS7, this:

<div style="width: 32px; height: 31px; background: url('http://i.i.cbsi.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim2/2013/11/08/fb1.png'); background-size: 75px; background-position-x: 37px; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0;">
</div>

The icon&#8217;s what forced me into upgrading; _had to _try as it was bound to come with a number of new features and not just a change of icon. Well, I installed it, and ran it.

I was welcom-ed by a screen, all white (they dropped the light-blue background), which asked me if I was indeed &#8216;Anas Ismail Khan.&#8217; As I proceeded, I was asked to confirm my number, which would _ensure_ that people find me using my number, _regardless _of whether or not I&#8217;m part of the friendlist, **but, **this is optional. The reason behind it, I guess, is that they are moving towards making it into an independent messenger, which combines the best of both Kik and whatsapp. It&#8217;s similar to whatsapp in the sense that just having your number might do the trick, however the ___friendlist_ of course is still there, and thus the contacts list would consist of both your phone&#8217;s contacts and your Facebook Friends. However, due to privacy settings perhaps, usernames dont always work either, and just like the number _thing _this might be optional as well.

They also eradicated the _&#8216;__sms integration&#8217;_  feature. You can no longer use this app as your primary messaging app, though the changelog might say something similar.

> A strange _con _of the app happens to be the fact that there is no _&#8216;log out&#8217; _option. On androids, clearing the app data does the trick though..
