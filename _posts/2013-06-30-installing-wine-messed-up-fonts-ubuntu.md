A known problem that _I myself experienced_, when I logged into Facebook, after rebooting to complete the installation of WINE. A tool that aims at _enabling windows programs to run on other platforms_.

So, what actually happens is that WINE installs a number of Microsoft Fonts, and well, Â I guess, one of them happens to be on Facebook&#8217;s _alternative fonts,_ (the default one being Lucida Grande, which is **NOT included** in the package installed by WINE).

The problem can be fixed by simply uninstalling the package &#8216;msttcorefonts.&#8217; You can do this either via the &#8216;Ubuntu Software Center&#8217;, or the terminal.

To do this via the terminal, use:

**sudo apt-get remove msttcorefonts**
