Back in 1950, [Turing&#8217;s paper](http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html), titled &#8220;Computer machinery and Intelligence,&#8221; was published in journal called &#8220;Mind,&#8221; and it was one of the things that can be credited for changing the way people thought about machines. Some readers were awestruck, while others only saw gibberish.

The paper, in a fair-amount of detail, spoke of computers, and the possibility of them being indistinguishable from a human in the future. The present day, may or may not be the future in question, but we have most definitely made a fine dent. Turing spoke of storage, and memory and processing and instructions, and of _word, _in the second part of his article titled &#8220;_Digital Computers._&#8221; The model of computing defined in his article is what we know today as the _Turing Machine._

The part on digital computers was preceded by _&#8220;The Imitation Game.&#8221; _<del>You might be familiar with the 2014 movie of the same name, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a young Alan Turing who builds an intelligent-machine so as to be able to decrypt the messages encrypted by the german <em>Enigma </em>machine</del>. The Imitation Game, which is defined finely in his article, is what could be used as a Turing Test, so as to determine how close a machine is to imitating the behavior and thinking capability of a human being, and whether or not it could possibly hoodwink a human into mistaking itself for a human. The Turing Test is a popular topic for discussion among enthusiasts, and developers perform different forms of it on their AI creations to this day.

I could go on for a while, but there&#8217;s honestly no point to it, and your time could be better spent reading [the original article.](http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html)
