Like the breadcrumb address bar in Windows Vista/7? want the same thing in XP?  
Download and install [QTAdressbar](http://qttabbar.wikidot.com/qtaddressbar).

You might have to restart your PC after the installation.

anyways, once the installation process has completed, open windows explorer,

goto Menu>View and enable the QTaddressbar.
