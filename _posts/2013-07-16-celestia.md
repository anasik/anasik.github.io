[Celestia](http://www.shatters.net/celestia/) is aÂ **3D simulator of the Solar System.Â **It&#8217;s pretty amazing actually. You can move about, lock onto planets,Â _land on their surface.Â _It&#8217;s not exactly limited to the solar system, more likeÂ _theÂ Universe,Â _i.e. as much of it is known to mankind.Â You can even move out and visit other _galaxies, systems, e.t.c.Â _

It also has aÂ _&#8220;TLC Feature ðŸ˜€ &#8221;Â _that enables you to speed up or slow down time, or evenÂ _stop it, or reverse it.Â _That;s not all, it has a lot of features and is definitely worth trying.

Installing it in Ubuntu is relatively easy, simply fire up a terminal(CTRL + Alt + T), and paste the following code:  
`sudo apt-get install celestia-gnome`
