Windows XP, successor to 98, was a huge leap for MS, and well perhaps the most stable version of Windows ever in its time, the first release of which was launched in 2000, is still widely used. Whether itÂ _shouldÂ _still be used or not, is highly debatable. Some loyal supporters would argue with the fact that it&#8217;s about 3 versions old and yet extremely stable and supports everything, while others who have (or at least claim to) have looked into the issue state that, it&#8217;s no longer secure, and that it has compatibility issues and all.

Canonical seized the chance and began working on it immediately. The Ubuntu Start Project, the first releases of which are already up and available, aims to provide Windows XP users, (_or_ users with PCs that support nothing much higher than XP,) with a _&#8220;modern, unique, stable, fast, powerful, highly customizable, active and amazing community based system, open-source, free Linux-based system which should replace their very old no longer supported system.&#8221;Â _

From what I can make out after reading [this](https://launchpad.net/ubuntustart), in itself, the project is more of a campaign to gain more users than a new redefined OS. Means that despite itsÂ _purpose,Â _Â and howÂ _bigÂ _the whole thing sounds, 50% of the project is just about persuading people to switch to Ubuntu, while the rest i.e. the software bit of the project is a script that has to be runÂ _after installing ubuntu,Â _that would kinda enhance it for windows users so that they don&#8217;t have trouble getting used to the new environment, e.g.Â _moving window buttons from left to right ðŸ˜€ ._ Auto-mounting NTFS drives, (cause we are too lazy to make a single click), and it also installs GIMP, WINE, DropBox, some torrent client, and other such tools that oneÂ _mightÂ _need.

Can&#8217;t really say much about this myself as i haven&#8217;t tried the script myself yet.. however this was a smart move by Canonical, but on the other hand, XP users, if you are by any chance planning to make the switch, be prepared, for Linux is Linux. (no offence meant)
