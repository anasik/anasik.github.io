You are familiar with the term plug-and-play; if not, well, just google it ðŸ˜‰ Anyways, we use countless plug and play devices, but ever heard of a plug and play Operating System(OS)?  
Slax is just another one of the countless linux distros, but the best thing about it is that it&#8217;s plug and play. Just boot using a Slax live CD or USB, and it&#8217;d start up. The initial setting-up processes hardly take a minute, and no install required.

It&#8217;s quite stable and pretty useful, plus the total size of the disk image is just 210MB, now isnt that efficiently coded!

Here, [grab your own copy of slax](http://www.slax.org/en/download.php) and give it a try, and i assure you that it won&#8217;t at all mess up your existing OS as no installation is required.
