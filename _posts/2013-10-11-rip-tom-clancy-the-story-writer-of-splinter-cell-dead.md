![Tom Clancy](http://media.avclub.com/images/439/439338/16x9/627.jpg?7694)  
Tom Clancy, American, and well known to gamers as the guy behind the storylines of Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six, died on the 1st of October 2013, i.e. a few days back _yes.Â _If one would step out of the gaming world, they&#8217;d realise that there was more to him than just producing games. He wrote a number of books, but almost all of his works, at least the ones i know of, were all really about warfare, military e.t.c.

At the age of 66, he died of some sort of illness, the nature of which wasn&#8217;t really made public.
