A swap partition is simply the place from which your computer borrows some memory if it runs out of RAM. The RAM is way faster than the hard disk, but in case you do run out of memory, and are in real need of it, the computer resorts to paging, and borrows some **&#8220;virtual-memory&#8221; **from the hard-disk, and in computers running linux, it borrows from the swap partition.
