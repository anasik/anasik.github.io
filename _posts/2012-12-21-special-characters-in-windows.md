You might have noticed people making strange characters like &#8220;☺☻♥&#8221; on facebook e.t.c. Some of these, take the heart for example, can be _**Triggered** _using special codes, in this case, &#8220;<3&#8221;. But not every single one of them has codes known to public.

Anyways, these characters can be added by pressing Alt + (any key from the num-pad).

Examples:

  1. alt + 1 = ☺
  2. alt + 2 = ☻
  3. alt + 3 = ♥
