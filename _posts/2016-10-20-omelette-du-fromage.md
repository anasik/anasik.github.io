So, around the time Assasin&#8217;s Creed Unity came out, I came across this video. It was quite popular among my friends back then. At 1:18, we see two guys seated on a table facing one another and as something lands on it, one of them says: _&#8220;Oh no! My omelette du fromage&#8221; _at which, Arno pops up and replies: _&#8220;It&#8217;s actually omelette au fromage.&#8221; _That&#8217;s the first and last time I heard that phrase.



A few days ago, I came across the term again somewhere on the internet and so I googled it. Its literal meaning being _&#8220;omelette of cheese,&#8221;_ it actually originates from an episode of the popular tv show _&#8220;Dexter&#8217;s Laboratory.&#8221; _The episode itself is called _&#8220;The Big Cheese,&#8221; _in which, Dexter can&#8217;t say anything except _&#8220;oomelette du fromage&#8221;. _

Funnily enough, throughout the episode, his day at school is better than the average because, as it happens, saying that same damned phrase everytime he opens his mouth, seems to work out just fine for him. He nails a french test, and a mathematics question and gets a bunch of girls fawning, and even manages to deal with some bullies.

So why does Arno say _&#8220;It&#8217;s actually omelette au fromage.&#8221;? _Because _&#8220;omelette au fromage&#8221; _means _&#8220;omelette with cheese,&#8221; _and that&#8217;s the correct term to use for a cheese omelete. As you can guess, _fromage _ means cheese, while omelette means pretty much what you think it does. Therefore, _&#8220;du&#8221;=&#8221;of&#8221; and &#8220;au&#8221;=&#8221;with.&#8221;_
