> Once there was an elephant,  
> Who tried to use the telephant—  
> No! No! I mean an elephone  
> Who tried to use the telephone—  
> (Dear me! I am not certain quite  
> That even now I&#8217;ve got it right.)  
> Howe&#8217;er it was, he got his trunk  
> Entangled in the telephunk;  
> The more he tried to get it free,  
> The louder buzzed the telephee—  
> (I fear I&#8217;d better drop the song  
> Of elephop and telephong!)
