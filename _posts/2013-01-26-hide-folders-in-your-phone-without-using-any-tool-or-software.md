This is a simple but useful trick for hiding folders in your phone without any special software/tool. This works in almost all phones, at least it did in every single one i tried.

Well, thats all you have to do.

  1. Name the folder &#8220;anything.**jad**&#8220;, at first this would be visible, But that&#8217;s normal.
  2. To hide it, all u have to do is, create another folder with the same name but Â replace the last bit, i.e. the extension, (which in this case is jad,)with **.Jar**. That&#8217;s it.
  3. Now the Jar folder would be visible but the jad one wont.

Its not exactly the best choice, as the &#8220;.jar&#8221; is visible in the folders name, but still, its the quickest and easiest way, plus, not everyone knows about these extensions.

> Note: To un-hide that jad folder, just delete the jar one.
