Nokia, the Finnish manufacturer of Mobile devices, which has been a bit _&#8216;out of the game&#8217; _in the recent years, especially since they gave up on the Symbian Mobile platform, and started with the Asha series, and could have had to face worse if it hadnt been for Microsoft, and they hadn&#8217;t produced the Lumia series of Windows Smartphones.

Yesterday, it was announced that the two have come to an agreement, where Microsoft is to purchase Nokia, and ensure the delivery of better and yet exciting devices. The transaction, according to the Technet blog, is to be made during the first quarter of 2014.

This might really put Nokia _back in the game_ as a rival to HTC, Samsung and Apple, (which it already was, but not totally,) except that it will not be the same _nokia _anymore, but merely Microsoft, cloaked under the name, a change of which hasn&#8217;t yet been announced, and is likely to stay that way.

> So,  
> Samsung, Apple, Huawei and of course HTC&#8230;  
> GAME ON!
