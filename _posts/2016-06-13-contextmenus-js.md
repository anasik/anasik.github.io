> Purely Javascript based solution allowing for easy creation of right-click context menus. [Browse the code on GitHub.](https://github.com/anasik/contextmenus.js) [Demo](http://anasismail.com/others/contextmenu)

So, [Haider](http://haidrr.com) posted on his Facebook timeline, a link to his then newly setup [github repo](https://github.com/candh/rightClick) which he had named &#8220;rightclick.js.&#8221; It was pretty clear what it was about so I gave his code a look. He is using _JQuery,_ and <del><em>(for some reason unclear to me,)</em></del>_ NodeJS._

This morning, I decided to make my own in pure Javascript. I started around afternoon and got done with it a couple of hours ago. <del>I wanted to call it <em>contextmenu.js </em>but there already exists a script by that name, and thus, out of respect, I renamed mine to <em>contextmenus.js.</em></del>_ _[The code](https://github.com/anasik/contextmenus.js) happens to be a couple of files that together take up a total of 1812 Bytes of disk space. Everything  that you need to know, in order to get it to work for you, is explained in the [README.md](https://github.com/anasik/contextmenus.js/blob/master/README.md) on the [GitHub](https://github.com/anasik/contextmenus.js) page.
