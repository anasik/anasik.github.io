Raring Ringtail is a short term release, which would be supported for 9 months, successor to Ubuntu 12.10 Quantam Quetzal.

Excitedly, most of the users have made the switch, almost of them expecting to see a real change in the OS. This could be partly due to the fact that they&#8217;ve got tired of using the same old interface, and can do with slight changes, and partly due to the fact that they aren&#8217;t satisfied with its performance.  
The question arises, is there anything new in new-est version of the OS?

Well, there have certainly been a few slight changes, i.e. _visual ones_, that include an &#8220;ubuntu one&#8221; icon in the top bar, similar to that of the &#8220;[CloudApp](http://cloud.trashness.com)&#8221; in MacOSX.Â Apart from that, there is now a BT menu in the top bar, with a few essential options.<img alt="&quot;Screenshot" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3752/9131497937_b129d499ac_o.png" width="290" height="131" />

The &#8220;Dash&#8221; icon, has been changed to.. well, this:  
<img alt="13.04 icons" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2820/9133709710_a22b651321_o.png" width="63" height="531" /><img alt="icons 12.10" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/9131503433_a547904f20_o.png" width="63" height="500" /> 

> 13.04&#8217;s launcher vs 12.10s (sorry for the poor quality of the latter.)

Similarly, the &#8220;Software Center&#8221; icon has been redefined along with the &#8220;Workspaces&#8221; Icon, (which by the way are not enabled in 13.04 by default; see [this post](http://anasismail.com/enabling-workspaces-in-ubuntu-13-04-raring-ringtail)), and what used to be the &#8220;Home Folder&#8221; in the older versions, is now known as &#8220;File Manager,&#8221; (complete with a new icon.) All the icons are now _slightly more pointed_, means the corners are less round.

So, these were all the visual changes. Now to _performance._  
I&#8217;m sorry to say that it&#8217;s still the same old ubuntu, still a bit slow, even on _&#8220;hi-fi&#8221; spec-ed_ computers. _YET,_ i can see a reduce in the lags, e.g. it actually used to hang whenever i&#8217;d start a VM in 12.10, but in 13.04, i actually managed to run a VM alongside Chrome and the software center!
