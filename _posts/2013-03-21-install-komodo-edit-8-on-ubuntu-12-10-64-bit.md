Komodo edit is a code editor and an alternative to notepad++, in fact, its even better, and runs in all 3 i.e. Linux, Mac and Windows.Â Installing it in linux can be a bit tricky for newbies, so here&#8217;s what you need to do.

[Download the archive](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads), and extract it wherever you wish, but if you dont wanna complicate things for yourself, just extract them into the home folder.

Open a terminal windows by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T, and navigate to the directory where you extracted the archive. To do so, type:

**cd your_directory.**

If you extracted it into the home folder, just copy and paste this code:

**cd Komodo-Edit-8.0.0-12188-linux-x86_64**

Once in the directory, type:

**./install.sh**, and press enter. Now it&#8217;ll prompt you for the install directory, which doesnt honestly make much difference, so just leave it blank and press enter. That&#8217;s it!
