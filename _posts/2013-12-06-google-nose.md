Ages ago, many of us noticed the addition of a strangely _catching_ tab on Googles pages. Some ignored, with the presumption that it&#8217;s another new product by Google, while some investigated.  
The idea, as it said on the Google Nose&#8217;s home page was that users could actually _sniff_ __stuff they search for. An example they themselves gave in a screenshot was &#8220;wet dog.&#8221; As you click on the Nose button, it&#8217;d instruct you to bring your nose close to the screen and sniff, and when you do, the screen would go all frosty at places, but you won&#8217;t even get a whiff of what a wet dog is supposed to smell like, cause the whole Google Nose thing was nothing but an April fool joke!
