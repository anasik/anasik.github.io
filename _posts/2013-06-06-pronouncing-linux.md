A topic quite debatable, as to whether it is pronounced as &#8220;lie-nucks&#8221;, or as &#8220;lee-nucks.&#8221;

Though, ive always pronounced it as the latter, I realized that Linux has been named after Linus Torwalds, and the forename in question, I heard being pronounced as &#8220;lie-nuss,&#8221; and therefore decided to correct this.. _error.Â _

I actually researched on the subject, and on the internet, i came across this recording of Linus Torwalds himself, pronouncing the word as Linus.

Here, [give it a &#8220;](http://www.paul.sladen.org/pronunciation/torvalds-says-linux.mp3)_[hear.&#8221;](http://www.paul.sladen.org/pronunciation/torvalds-says-linux.mp3)__Â  Â _ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜‰
