I&#8217;m a lazy nerd with a keen interest in almost everything interesting out there. I love Computer-Science, Electronics, Automobile Engineering and Physics. Sometimes I&#8217;m a programmer and sometimes I&#8217;m a physicist, and if I didn&#8217;t have other interests, I wouldn&#8217;t have minded being a mathematician. I&#8217;d make a great psychologist.

As you can see, I also blog often<del>, although I may not do it too frequently or periodically</del>. I write about the things I learn, about things I analyze and form beliefs about, and often I just think out loud. Very occasionally, I do reviews. I do share a lot of quotes though.

Skills:

  * Web-Designing and Development (LAMP)
  * Bricking/Unbricking Android devices
  * UI/UX Concepting
  * Creative Writing
  * Leading/Managing Projects
  * Logical and Critical Thinking
  * Planning and Analysing
  * Correcting Typos
  * Vivid Imagination
  * Empathy
  * Commitment

Like everyone else out there I enjoy fiction and video-gaming. I&#8217;m a fan of:

  * Harry Potter
  * Dan Brown&#8217;s Robert Langdon Series
  * Marvel Cinematic Universe
  * DC&#8217;s Extended Universe and animated works
  * Transformers
  * Assassin&#8217;s Creed
  * Need For Speed _(I hate you I love you)_
